## ðŸš€ Run locally

1.  **Install NPM**

2.  **Clone the repo**

3.  **Setup the Environment**
    You will need to setup an .env.development file in the root with a Contentful spaceID and access token. 

    ```shell
    CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID=space_id_goes_here
    CONTENTFUL_ACCESS_TOKEN=access_token_goes_here
    ```

4.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Navigate your terminal to the repo's folder and run these commands:

    ```shell
    npm install && npm run develop
    ```

5.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby Tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/part-4/#use-graphiql-to-explore-the-data-layer-and-write-graphql-queries)._

6.  **Below is a sample of the deploy script I'm using in Github actions**

    ```shell
    name: Deploy

    on:
    push:
    branches: [ main ]

    jobs:
    build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v2.1.5
        with:
          node-version: 14
          
      - name: Build
        run: |
          npm install
          npm run build
        env:
          CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID: ${{ secrets.CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID }}
          CONTENTFUL_ACCESS_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.CONTENTFUL_ACCESS_TOKEN }}

      - uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v1
        with:
          aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
          aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
          aws-region: us-east-1
      - run: aws s3 sync ./public s3://yours3bucketname
    ```
